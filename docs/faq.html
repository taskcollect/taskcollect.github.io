	<h2 id="origins">Origins</h2>
	<h4 id="origins-q1">What is the purpose of the project?</h4>
	<p>
		The original purpose of the project was to tackle an aggravating issue — teachers in each class
		would use multiple educational platforms to teach, and often these chosen sets of platforms
		differed from teacher to teacher. The amount of housekeeping required each night from the
		perspective of a student was enormous — one had to keep track of resources and tasks across over
		ten platforms. A request to our school administration for the unification of educational
		platforms would have unlikely been realised. We chose an alternative route — to build a platform
		that would act as a single interface to all existing platforms — a platform multiplexer. While
		the issue became somewhat less serious in the coming months, we continued our project in hope
		that we could help all students in our school be more productive in their learning.
	</p>
	<p>
		Moving towards the v1 release, we realised TaskCollect also served another useful function — it
		acted as a "frontend" to platforms we didn't particularly like. This mindset, coupled with the
		notion of a "learning manager" program that would give students full control of their learning,
		gave rise to the v2 proposal.
	</p>
	<h4 id="origins-q2">Who made TaskCollect?</h4>
	<p>
		TaskCollect was developed by a team of four (then) secondary school students
		(<a href="https://kvo.envs.net">kvo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rayokamoto">rayokamoto</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/Wasabi1092">Wasabi1092</a>, <a href="https://al2f.codeberg.page/">al2f</a>)
		who spent significant time outside school hours writing the implementation for TaskCollect.
		The project leader and maintainer continues to be kvo.
	</p>
	<h4 id="origins-q3">Is TaskCollect finished?</h4>
	<p>
		Technically speaking, yes. TaskCollect reached version 1 in January 2023, and is thus
		considered "complete". However, we constantly find ways in which TaskCollect can be
		improved, and try to make changes accordingly. As an example of our continued work, a
		proposal for version 2 is currently being developed.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="left-banner light-banner">
	<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
	<h4 id="usage-q1">How do I access TaskCollect?</h4>
	<p>
		TaskCollect is currently developed as a web server, not an app, meaning
		that people can set up websites from the TaskCollect software
		(<i>instances</i> of TaskCollect). No public instances are currently
		available. If you want to use TaskCollect, you will need to download
		TaskCollect, run the web server on your computer, and access your local
		instance via <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>
	</p>
	<h4 id="usage-q2">Why is the TaskCollect server so difficult to install on my computer?</h4>
	<p>
		TaskCollect is developed as a web server, not an app, hence our software
		release & distribution process is catered to server administrators, not
		end users. We do not provide installers for TaskCollect, but you can
		follow <a href="../institutions/deploy.html">these steps</a> to deploy a
		TaskCollect instance on your own computer.
	</p>
	<h4 id="usage-q3">How do I use TaskCollect?</h4>
	<p>
		If you are using an existing TaskCollect isntance, simply navigate to
		its website. If you wish to self-host, follow
		<a href="../institutions/deploy.html">these steps</a>. A
		<a href="../docs/tour.html">tour</a> of TaskCollect is also available,
		should you wish to familiarise yourself with TaskCollect's features.
	</p>
	<h4 id="usage-q4">Will I never have to use platform X again?</h4>
	<p>
		If you're lucky, you might be able to use a platform entirely through
		TaskCollect. This depends on your use case and also the degree to
		which TaskCollect can support the platform in question. However,
		platforms might have proprietary features that are infeasible or
		impossible to provide an interface to. In these cases, TaskCollect
		might provide the URL to the relevant webpage on the platform (if one
		exists), or not implement support for that feature at all.
	</p>
	<p>
		Educational platform support is a community project. We don't
		guarantee that support for any given platform is complete nor existent.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="left-banner">
	<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
	<h4 id="features-q1">Why doesn't TaskCollect have feature X?</h4>
	<p>
		There are two possible reasons — either we have decided the feature
		would be harmful to our project goals, or no one has implemented it
		yet. Most likely, it is the latter. Our team is small and our time
		is limited — even features that are at the top of our priority list
		may need several months before they are implemented.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have a feature that is not listed on our ticket list, please
		send an email with your feature request to
		<a href="mailto:~kvo/taskcollect-discuss@lists.sr.ht">taskcollect-discuss@lists.sr.ht</a>
	</p>
	<h4 id="features-q2">Does TaskCollect support platform X?</h4>
	<p>
		Probably not. Platform support is a time-consuming and arduous task,
		and most of our team members are only willing to add platform support
		if they are individually affected and no one else volunteers to do it.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want a platform to be supported, you will most likely need to
		implement support yourself (and
		<a href="mailto:~kvo/taskcollect-devel@lists.sr.ht">email</a> your pull
		request to us), or hire someone to implement support for you (and
		send us a pull request). We do what we can, but we are just volunteers.
	</p>
	<h4 id="features-q3">Why is feature X not available even though platform Y implements it?</h4>
	<p>
		There oculd be several reasons for this. First, it could be simply
		that we are unaware of the feature. Another possibility is that we
		are aware that the feature exists but we have not yete had the time
		to implement it in TaskCollect. The final possible opiton is that we
		are aware of the feature but we believe that it would be unfitting to
		implement in TaskCollect — either because it is superfluous or there
		is a better way to solve hte source issue.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an example, TaskCollect does not support OAuth or TOTP MFA for
		login because it would make TaskCollect logins unnecessarily
		burdensome. Instead, TaskCollect automatically completes OAuth
		authentication by pretending to be a user inputting their credentials
		into the Oauth dialog, and automatically generates TOTP codes for MFA
		by having the user input their MFA secret key. As a result, TaskCollect
		users no longer have to worry about inputting their credentials 10
		times, or pulling out their phone for every login attempt.
	</p>
	<h4 id="features-q4">Will TaskCollect solve my time management issues?</h4>
	<p>
		Only you can solve your own time management issues. We provide you
		the tools to make time management easier, but as for the rest, the
		onus is on you.
	</p>
	<h4 id="features-q5">Why can't I view messages from platform X?</h4>
	<p>
		We believe in open standards, and proprietary message protocols are
		the opposite of that. We provide a button in TaskCollect that allows
		you to forward all unread messages to your email address, as emails.
		If you believe this will clutter your inbox, you should set up a rule
		for incoming emails from
		<code>no-reply@&lt;TASKCOLLECT-INSTANCE-HOSTNAME&gt;</code> (e.g. to
		move them to a  different email folder), where
		<code>&lt;TASKCOLLECT-INSTANCE-HOSTNAME&gt;</code> is the domain name
		of your TaskCollect instance.
	</p>
	<h4 id="features-q6">When will you fix bug X and/or implement feature Y?</h4>
	<p>
		If a ticket has not been filed to
		<a href="https://todo.sr.ht/~kvo/taskcollect">the issue tracker</a>, you
		should email us with your request at
		<a href="mailto:~kvo/taskcollect-discuss@lists.sr.ht">taskcollect-discuss@lists.sr.ht</a>.
		If a ticket has been filed, it is likely that we will not address your
		ticket for a number of months. We are full-time students, and our
		contributions to TaskCollect come from what free time we have left at
		the end of the day. If you think you have the knowledge and/or skills
		to address a ticket yourself, you are more than welcome to do so.
		<a href="../contrib.html">Contributions are welcome!</a>
	</p>
	<h4 id="features-q7">When will you make an app for TaskCollect?</h4>
	<p>
		We are currently in search of a GUI library that would suit the needs
		of TaskCollect. We are looking for a GUI library that:
	</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>can be statically linked with the TaskCollect executable</li>
  		<li>has support for Windows (amd64, i386), macOS (arm64, amd64), Linux (amd64, i386, arm64, arm), Android (arm64, arm, amd64, i386), and iOS (arm64, amd64)</li>
  		<li>can be trivially cross-compiled and cross-linked for all the above platforms</li>
  		<li>when used, results in code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		We are currently leaning towards creating our own GUI library for
		these purposes, using Go's
		<a href="https://godocs.io/golang.org/x/exp/shiny">exp/shiny</a> for our
		cross-platform backend and various existing high-level GUI libraries as
		inspiration for the programmer interface. Searches for existing
		libraries continue.
	</p>

<div class="left-banner light-banner">
	<h2 id="impl">Implementation</h2>
	<h4 id="impl-q1">Why is TaskCollect not written in language X?</h4>
	<p>
		TaskCollect is written in Go for a number of reasons. Firstly, it
		compiles easily across different operating systems and CPU architectures,
		and produces statically linked binaries. Secondly, it has great built-in
		support for networking, HTTP, concurrency, and HTML, all of which are
		highly important to TaskCollect. Thirdly, the language is easy to learn,
		which is crucial considering that contributors to TaskCollect will
		almost always be students. Go is certainly not a flawless language, but
		it is the best we can find that meets our requirements.
	</p>
	<h4 id="impl-q2">Are there any Docker images available for TaskCollect?</h4>
	<p>
		No. We believe running an additional operating system for each service
		is a harmful approach to developing distributed systems. In our opinion,
		the correct solution to solving the problem of "but it it works on my
		machine" is static library linking and trivial cross-compilation
		support, both of which are provided by Go. Distributed systems can be
		designed with plain executables as services, without the unnecessary
		overhead of an additional operating system.
	</p>
	<h4 id="impl-q3">Is TaskCollect scalable?</h4>
	<p>
		Not yet. The current implementation involves a single binary which
		does a multitude of tasks, ranging from authentication to handling
		HTTP requests to web scraping. A move to enforce separation of concerns
		is planned, but we cannot yet say when it will happen.
	</p>
	<h4 id="impl-q4">Why does TaskCollect not use JavaScript framework X?</h4>
	<p>
		We believe the coonsequences of using a JavaScript framework for
		TaskCollect outweigh the benefits. Having the entire interface generated
		by JavaScript means increased client-side bloat, reduced accessibility,
		an additional dependency tree we have to keep track of, and increased
		complexity in our building, running, and deployment processes. This is
		not what we want for our users nor our contributors.
	</p>
	<h4 id="impl-q5">Will you implement incremental loading?</h4>
	<p>
		No. See the <a href="#impl-q4">answer above</a>. To compensate for the
		fact that data retrieval from educational platforms is slow, we have
		implemented a loading animation mechanism that is both simple and doesn't
		require each page to be loaded by JavaScript.
	</p>
	<h4 id="impl-q6">Why is the TaskCollect repository not hosted on GitHub?</h4>
	<p>
		<a href="https://forgeperf.org">SourceHut is faster</a>. Additionally,
		SourceHut has first-class support for mailing lists, which makes it a
		much more attractive option than competitors such as GitHub or Codeberg.
	</p>
	<h4 id="impl-q7">Why is there a different version of TaskCollect on GitHub?</h4>
	<p>
		Disregarding unrelated projects with the same name, there is a GitHub
		organisation called TaskCollect with repositories that are closely related
		to TaskCollect's own mission. This is an earlier, discontinued
		implementation of TaskCollect with differing views on how it should have
		been implemented. The code hosted on GitHub was the work of
		<a href="https://github.com/xcodian">xcodian</a>,
		<a href="https://github.com/xxori">xxori</a>,
		<a href="https://kvo.envs.net">kvo</a>,
		and <a href="https://github.com/Wasabi1092">Wasabi1092</a>,
		and was almost ready for release. However, an important upstream platform
		(Daymap) changed its authentication mechanism and development ceased
		thereafter.
	</p>
	<h4 id="impl-q8">Why are you reimplementing portions of the Go standard library?</h4>
	<p>
		We found certain parts of the Go standard library (v1.18 when we started)
		insufficient for our needs. Given that our requirements were well within
		our development capabilities, we decided to reimplement the parts of the
		Go standard library we were least satisfied with.
	</p>
	<h4 id="impl-q9">Why have you done X instead of doing Y?</h4>
	<p>
		We always try to find an approach that best suits the needs of our users
		and contributors. Sometimes this means exploring a different approach to
		a problem, which might not be the standard way of solving the problem,
		but one that may resolve the problem more effectively for our use case.
		Sometimes we are disproven in this, but equally so we are sometimes
		disproven that the standard approach is the best.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="left-banner">
	<h2 id="errors">Troubleshooting</h2>
	<h4 id="errors-q1">Why is page X loading so slowly?</h4>
	<p>
		TaskCollect has been developed to be as fast as possible. If a page is
		loading slowly, it is most probable that the platform from/to which
		data is being received/sent is being slow, not TaskCollect.
		Unfortunately, even though TaskCollect tries to mitigate as many issues
		of the platforms it connects to as possible, latency issues are
		usually unavoidable.
	</p>
	<h4 id="errors-q2">Page X isn't loading and/or is displaying an error; why is that?</h4>
	<p>
		Most likely, TaskCollect failed to connect to an educational platform
		when retrieving/sending data. This is usually because the platform is
		unresponsive, or had a new interface/API change that breaks TaskCollect's
		support for that platform. In the rarer occasion that it isn't, the
		underlying problem is an unresolved bug in TaskCollect. Contact the
		administrator of your TaskCollect instance to identify the cause of
		the problem; they should have access to the server logs.
	</p>
	<h4 id="errors-q3">My institution isn't listed; what should I do?</h4>
	<p>
		If your institution is not listed in either the list of suported
		platforms, or on the TaskCollect login page, then your institution's
		educational platforms are not supported. If you would like institution
		support to be added, you should either
		<a href="../contact/enquiries.html">contact us</a> or
		<a href="../contrib.html">contribute to TaskCollect</a>.
	</p>
	<h4 id="errors-q4">Why can't I login with my institution-provided login details?</h4>
	<p>
		If you are having trouble logging in with your institution-provided
		login details, then likely TaskCollect support for your institution
		has encountered an issue. <a href="../contact/enquiries.html">Contact us</a>
		to resolve this issue.
