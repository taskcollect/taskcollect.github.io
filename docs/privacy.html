		"Privacy policy" refers to this document. "Service" refers to all that TaskCollect provides for

	<h2 id="required-data">Data we collect</h2>
	<p>
		We have a minimum data collection policy. TaskCollect collects as little data as possible, attempts
		to handle it as securely as possible, and we do not share any user data we collect to third parties
		other than that necessary for user authentication to the online platforms your school uses.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you choose to log into TaskCollect, you will (directly or indirectly) provide TaskCollect
		the following sensitive student information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Your school name</li>
		<li>The username you log in with</li>
		<li>The password you log in with</li>
		<li>Authentication tokens for the platforms TaskCollect supports for your school</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This data will be stored in an in-memory database which is only available to the TaskCollect
		server internally, and is never saved to persistent storage. This sensitive data that you provide
		is only used by TaskCollect to provide authenticated access to TaskCollect and authenticated data
		requests from the platforms TaskCollect supports for your school.
	</p>
	<p>
		TaskCollect also handles non-sensitive student data which includes but is not limited to student
		assessment pieces and learning material provided to students. This data is never stored, and is
		only processed and relayed between an authenticated user to whom the data belongs and the online
		platforms the user's school uses. As soon as the data is transmitted (successfully or unsuccessfully),
		the data is no longer on the server (unless another request for/with the same data is being processed at
		the same time).
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of TaskCollect's functionality provides a mechanism to send non-sensitive data to and interact with the
		online platforms your school uses. This includes but is not limited to task submission, work upload and work
		removal. As per our data collection policy, we do not share any user data that we collect to third parties
		(other than for authentication to the platforms your school uses), and therefore none of this data is transmitted to
		these platforms.
	</p>
	<p>
		The only data we collect that is sent to the third parties consists of authentication tokens for the online
		platforms your school uses. This means that in order to ensure all TaskCollect data requests coming from you for
		a certain platform are authenticated as coming from you, an authentication token for that platform is sent to the platform.
	</p>
	<p>
		TaskCollect uses browser cookies only to provide essential functionality for its use, such as keeping you
		logged into your current session. However, these cookies do not store any form of sensitive data, nor do
		they store any additional data that could be used for malicious purposes including but not limited to tracking.
