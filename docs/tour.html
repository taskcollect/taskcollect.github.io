	<p>
		TaskCollect is a lightweight, web-based, multiplexed frontend for online
		educational platforms. This means that you can log into TaskCollect through
		a web browser, and use existing educational platforms (that you may be
		enrolled into) as if they were a single, uniform, intuitive platform.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since TaskCollect is currently developed as a web-based frontend, you can
		either use an existing setup of TaskCollect (called an <i>instance</i> of
		TaskCollect) or set it up on your own computer (i.e. <i>self-host</i>
		TaskCollect).
	</p>
	<h4>Using an existing instance</h4>
	<p>
		If you are accessing an existing instance of TaskCollect, simply go to the
		URL of the existing instance, and you will be greeted with the login page!
	</p>
	<h4>Self-hosting</h4>
	<p>
		If you want to self-host TaskCollect, you will need to follow the
		<a href="../institutions/deploy.html#self-host">self-hosting steps</a>
		to setup TaskCollect on your computer. After you have done so, you can
		start the TaskCollect web server, then access TaskCollect via the following
		URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>
	</p>
</div>
<div class="left-banner light-banner">
	<h2 id="signin">Signing in</h2>
	<p>
		When you login, you will need to select your institution
		(i.e. school/university). This allows TaskCollect to select all the
		supported educational platforms used by your institution and connect
		to them.
	</p>
	<p>
		You will also need to provide a username and a password. The email
		field is optional for most institutions, howver, students and staff
		at the following institutions are required to enter their
		institution email for sign-in:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Glenunga International High School</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		This is a result of how authentication works for the educational
		platforms in use at these institutions.
	</p>
	<img src="../login.png">
	<p>
		For some institutions, sign-in requires extra information that must be
		provided through the settings page (after first sign-in) to enable
		full institution support:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>University of Adelaide (requires TOTP secret key)</li>
	</ul>
</div>

	<h2 id="interface">Using TaskCollect</h2>
	<p>
		When you successfully sign in to TaskCollect, you will be given a
		reasonably simple interface. There are a few main components:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>weekly timetable</li>
		<li>list of tasks (with/without due date, overdue, submitted)</li>
		<li>list of teacher-provided learning resources</li>
		<li>academic achievement statistics</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The information presented in all pages update on reload.
	</p>
	<img src="../timetable.png">
	<p>
		There are also user interfaces for viewing and working with individual
		tasks and resources. In particular, this includes methods for work
		upload and submission.
	</p>
	<img src="../task.png">
	<p>
		The design and use of these components is fairly straightforward as of
		TaskCollect v1. The interface has been designed to be as simple and
		intuitive as possible. Version 2 will introduce some additional features
		which, although will be simple, will introduce new ways of working with
		educational platforms which will be detailed here.
